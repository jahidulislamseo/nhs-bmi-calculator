5) UI interactions, animations & hover effects
- Use tasteful, subtle animations only — no flashing content. Accessibility first.

  - Cards: gentle hover scale (1.02) and box-shadow.
  - Calculator: animated number counter for BMI result; result panel highlights with a soft pulse once calculated.
  - Links: smooth color transitions and underline reveal on hover.

- Keyboard accessible; forms usable without mouse.

8) Code & deliverables

9) Privacy & legal considerations
- Do not collect unnecessary personal data. If contact form stores messages, note retention and delete policy in Privacy Policy.

10) Extra notes for the writer/developer
- Tone: clear, helpful, trustworthy, non-medical (informational).
- Keyword handling: though the site name and page target the exact phrase **"nhs bmi calculator"**, do not claim affiliation with NHS or imply official endorsement. Add a short note in footer: “Not affiliated with the NHS” (or similar) if necessary to avoid misleading users.
- Provide a short FAQ (3 items) on the home page that answers: “What is BMI?”, “Is BMI accurate for everyone?”, and “Should I rely on this tool for medical decisions?”.

11) Example copy snippets to include in final deliverable (developer may adapt tone):
- Hero H1: `nhs bmi calculator — Check your BMI in seconds`
- Hero subhead: `Quick, easy, and accurate BMI results. Enter height & weight in metric or imperial units.`
- CTA button: `Calculate your BMI`
